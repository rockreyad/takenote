          Wow, what an audience. But if I&apos;m being honest, I don&apos;t care
          what you think of my talk. I don&apos;t. I care what the internet
          thinks of my talk. Because they&apos;re the ones who get it seen and
          get it shared. And I think that&apos;s where most people get it wrong.
          They&apos;re talking to you here, instead of talking to you, random
          person scrolling Facebook. Thanks for the click. You see, back in
          2009, we all had these weird little things called attention spans.
          Yeah, they&apos;re gone. They&apos;re gone. We killed them.
          They&apos;re dead. I&apos;m trying to think of the last time I watched
          an 18-minute TED Talk. It&apos;s been years, literally years. So if
          you&apos;re given a TED Talk, keep it quick. I&apos;m doing mine in
          under a minute. I&apos;m at 44 seconds right now. That means
          we&apos;ve got time for one final joke. Why are balloons so expensive
